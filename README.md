# Aquarium-Lite
Mainly just supposed to be a mostly complete base with a few decent checks
1.8 only

Features:
 - lots of lag compensation (world, potions, vehicles, etc)
 - bounding boxes i stole from grim :)
 - log system
 - cool config
 - moderateish performance although i need to recode a couple things for better performance
